This project uses the node JS platform.
You can clone or download this repository which includes the HTML/image and Javscript
files.

First time users may have to install npm and the node package modules and the respective 
dependecies which are available at package.json.  
After installation of all the required modules, launch your terminal and start the server.js file by entering the command: node server.js. 
This server will receive requests at your localhost IP address/127.0.0.1 coupled with the port number 8080.
Launch your desired browser and make requests to the above.
(For example: http://localhost:8080/authors )
